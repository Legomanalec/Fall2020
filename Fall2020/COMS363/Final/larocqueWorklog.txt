* Began work on data insertion
   * Adam’s tasks:
      * Read me Excel columns - basic readme for installation and running, password is 363F2020

* Began work on queries 
   * Adam’s tasks:
      * Q9, Q16, I & D - I and D were straightforward, just needed to make sure to assign all the correct privileges

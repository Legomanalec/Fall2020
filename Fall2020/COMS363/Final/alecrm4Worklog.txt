* Team talked about project
* Began work on ER diagram
   * Alec’s task:
      * Create hashtags table

* Began work on data insertion
   * Alec’s task: 
      * Add LOAD DATA INFILE statements based on excel columns - This took longer than it should have. I couldn't find "Program Data" for the life of me.
      * Created createDBUsers.sql - Was tricky to figure out how to create the username as piazza and modules differed.
* Began work on queries 
   * Alec’s task:
      * Q3, Q7, Q18 & Q23 - Q3 and Q18 were really hard, took me a while to figure out how to return arrays of values in MySQL. Q7 and Q23 where easier and straight forward.


11/12/2020
* Began work on optimizations
   * Alec’s task:
      * Optimize Q3, Q7, Q18 & Q23 - tested random indexes till they would decrease time, couldn't find ones fro 3 and 23 so I used bufferpool size adjustments
      * Filled out Optimization table - Took a long time
